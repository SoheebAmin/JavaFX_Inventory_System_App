# JavaFX Inventory App

This is a JavaFX application build with Java 11.2, JavaFX 11.0.2, and Scene Builder. 

It is an inventory management system that allows the user to add, modify, and delete parts and products. Parts can be marked as either in-house or outsourced. Parts can be associated to products.

There is validation to ensure that every piece of information given makes sense within the app (types are correct, min-max values are validated) and appropriate error prompts are given
